          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            Mic’d Up Initiative (MUI) is a mission-driven youth institution
            committed to transforming campus culture by amplifying authentic
            student voices, talents, and ideas through storytelling, mentorship,
            research, productions, and public conversations.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
            MUI was born from a simple but urgent realization: campus voices
            exist, but many are unheard, misrepresented, or poorly stewarded.

              The Origin
            </h2>

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              The journey began as a campus-based podcast—Mic’d Up Campus
              Podcast—hosted by Sir Anthony Munene. The initial vision was
              clear: to create space for students, lecturers, and education
              stakeholders to speak honestly about campus life and the forces
              shaping it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              While engaging students at Murang’a University of Technology, Sir
              Anthony encountered something deeper than content opportunities.
              He identified purpose-led voices, quiet leaders, thoughtful
              thinkers, and students carrying a burden for meaning, integrity,
              and direction.
            </p>

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              Through conversations, shared reflections, and vision-casting
              moments, it became evident that what was emerging was not merely
              a podcast—but a calling toward intentional cultural formation.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
              As the vision matured, it attracted alignment. A core team of
              directors—David Testimony, Daisy Mutheu, Hopewin Adams, John
              Mwandown, Sandra Mutanu, and Peter Bahati—came together around a
              shared burden, values, and aspiration.
